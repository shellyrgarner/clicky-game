# clicky-game

Created a memory game with React.  

Images are shuffled randomly after an image is clicked.  The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time.  The users's score is reset to 0 if an image is clicked more than once.  After an incorrect guess, the game restarts and the user's score is reset.
